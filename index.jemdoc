I am a Research Fellow with the
[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-and-optimization/ Machine Learning group]
at [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/india/ Microsoft Research India]
where I have been working with [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/prajain/ Dr. Prateek Jain]
and [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/venkie/ Dr. Ramarathnam Venkatesan].
My interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning and Systems. I am interested in designing algorithms
for large scale systems (large scale optimization) as well as design aspects of systems for Machine Learning.\n

I graduated with a B.Tech in [http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/ Compuer Science and Engineering]
from [https://www.iitm.ac.in/ IIT Madras] in 2015.
