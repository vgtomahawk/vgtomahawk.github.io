<h1>Research Interests</h1>
</div>
<p>I am interested in building effective large scale Machine Learning systems. There are two aspects to this problem.
One from the Machine Learning side and other from the Systems side.<br /></p>
<p>From the Machine Learning side we would like to design fast algorithms with theoretical
guarantees that exploit the characteristics of a system, like parallelism, it will be
deployed upon or work under the constraints of it, like working with restricted amount of data as in the
distributed computing scenario or working on encrypted data or working with streaming data.<br /></p>
<p>From system design perspective, we would like to know how to design systems to perform large scale
Machine Learning tasks efficiently. This might involve answering questions like: What are the most
frequent operations performed while executing a Machine Learning algorithm and how can a system be
optimized for these operations?<br /></p>
<p>I believe expertise in both the areas would be inevitable to build a successful system.</p>
