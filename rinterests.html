<h1>Research Interests</h1>
</div>
<p>Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). <br /></p>
<p>More specifically, I am interested in problems related to Natural Language Generation (NLG), where the goal is to generate a sentence given some initial conditions e.g in French-to-English translation we have to generate an English sentence given a French sentence. With the advent of distributed representations and recurrent neural networks, the standard NLG tasks such as translation and summarization have already been conquered (to a considerable extent). Within NLG, I am specifically interested in three settings where the learning process is constrained. <br/></p>
<p>
<ol>
<li><p>Where there is creative choice involved in the generation process - examples include poems and portmanteaus - creative choice increases the amount of data required for training (since several, diverse alternatives are possible - hence flatter distributions) - while also having lesser data available in practice (there are many books and news articles, but much fewer poems written) </p></li>
<li><p></p></li>
</ol>
<br/></p>
<p>I believe AI agents which can converse in NL, communicate in NL, perform creative linguistic tasks, and explain/justify their actions/choices in NL, are essential to realize an AI-enhanced society</p>
