<h1>Research Interests</h1>
</div>
<p>Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). <br /></p>
<p>More specifically, I am interested in problems related to Natural Language Generation (NLG), where the goal is to generate a sequence  given some initial conditions/input  e.g French-to-English translation, where one has to generate an English sentence given a French sentence. 

With the advent of distributed representations and recurrent neural networks, the standard NLG tasks such as translation and summarization have already been conquered (to a considerable extent). Within NLG, I am specifically interested in three settings where the learning process is constrained. <br/></p>
<p>
<ol>
<li><p>Where there is creative choice involved in the generation process - examples include poems and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01176">portmanteaus</a> - creative choice increases the amount of data required for training (since several, diverse alternatives are possible - hence flatter distributions) - while also having lesser data available in practice (there are many books and news articles, but much fewer poems written). Clever pre-training and initialization using related; often non-creative tasks or leveraging language level resources such as dictionaries and word-word networks are some ways of allievating some of these problems.  </p></li>
<li><p>Where the task requires a model which not only generates answers or predictions, but explains or justifies them - examples include <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08852">generating stock market predictions from news</a> terms along with explanations for each term;; or answering questions with evidence. Generating explanations often requires constraining the learning process in various ways - and doing so without affecting performance is a challenge. Difficulty of evaluating is a good explanation, along with lack of ground truth are other problems.  </p></li>
<li><p> Generation tasks for low-resource languages or output domains - one example is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01161">transferring the style of a piece of text</a> to another dialect (from a different region; or a different time period) of the same language. Scarcity of direct training data (parallel pairs like in Machine Translation) is a major problem in these settings. Typical ways of allievating this include use of external resources like dictionaries or cognate language resources; intelligent pre-training and initialization on auxiliary tasks; models with better structure/constraints and parameter sharing.</p></li>  
</ol>
<br/></p>
<p>I believe AI agents which can converse in NL, communicate in NL, perform creative linguistic tasks, and explain/justify their actions/choices in NL, are essential to realize an AI-enhanced society.</p>
